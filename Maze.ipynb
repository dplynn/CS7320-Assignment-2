        "\n",
        "In this exercise, we will implement the planning function for a type of goal-based agent called a __planning agent__. The planning function uses a map it is given to plan a path through the maze from the starting location $S$ to the goal location $G$. We will only focus on the planning function, so you do not need to implement an environment, just use the map to search for a path to solve the maze.\n",
        "\n",
        "Once the plan is made, the agent in a deterministic environment (i.e., the transition function is deterministic with the outcome of each state/action pair fixed and no randomness) can just follow the plan step-by-step and does not need to care about the percepts.\n",
        "This is also called an **[open-loop system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-loop_controller).**\n",
        "The execution phase is trivial and can be executed using a model-based reflex agent\n",
        "that ignores all percepts and just follows the plan. I will show you a short example, but you do not implement it in this exercise.\n",
        "\n",
        "Given that the agent has a complete and correct map, the environment is **fully observable, discrete, deterministic, and known.**\n",
        "Remember:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Fully observable** means that the agent can see its state and what the available actions are. That means the **percepts contain the complete current state.**\n",
        "Here, during planning, the agent always sees its x and y coordinates on the map and\n",
        "also seeks when it has reached the goal state.\n",
        "* **Discrete** means that we have a **finite set of states.** The maze has a finite set\n",
        "of squares the agent can be in.\n",
        "* **Deterministic** means that the **transition function contains no randomness.** An action in a state will always produce the same result. Going south from the start state always will lead to the same square.\n",
        "* **Know** means that the agent **knows the complete transition function.** The\n",
        "agent has the map and therefore knows how its position changes when it walks in a direction.\n",
        "\n",
        "Tree search algorithm implementations that you find online typically come from data structures courses and have a different aim than AI tree search. These algorithms assume that you already have a tree in memory. We are interested in dynamically creating a search tree with the aim of finding a good/the best path from the root note to the goal state. Follow the pseudo code presented in the text book (and replicated in the slides) closely. Ideally, we would like to search only a small part of the maze, i.e., create a search tree with as few nodes as possible.\n",

While this is an effective idea for this two-dimensional navigation problem, it typically cannot be used for other search problems. Therefore, follow the textbook and **do not store information in the map.** Only store information in the tree created during search, and use the `reached` and `frontier` data structures where appropriate.\n",
        "* DSF behavior can be implemented using the BFS tree search algorithm and simply changing the order in which the frontier is expanded (this is equivalent to best-first search with path length as the criterion to expand the next node). However, this would be a big mistake since it combines the bad space complexity of BFS with the bad time complexity of DFS! **To take advantage of the significantly smaller memory footprint of DFS, you need to implement DFS in a different way without a `reached` data structure (often also called `visited` or `explored`) and by releasing the memory for nodes that are not needed anymore.**\n",
        "* Since the proper implementation of DFS does not use a `reached` data structure, redundant path checking abilities are limited to cycle checking.\n",
